                slug: "trump-foreign-policy-overhaul-2025",
                excerpt: "Upon taking office in January 2025, President Trump's administration swiftly withdrew from the Paris Agreement and WHO, imposed broad tariffs, and prioritized 'America First' policies, ending an era of U.S.-led multilateralism.",
                content: `<p>Upon taking office in January 2025, President Trump's administration swiftly withdrew from the Paris Agreement on climate change and the World Health Organization (WHO), citing them as burdensome to U.S. interests. Broad tariffs were imposed on imports from China, Europe, and other regions, escalating trade wars and disrupting global supply chains.</p>

<p>Trump claimed to end U.S. involvement in multiple foreign wars, including reduced commitments in Ukraine and the Middle East, though conflicts persisted with lingering U.S. support in some areas. This marked a shift away from U.S.-led multilateralism, prioritizing "America First" policies.</p>

<h3>Impact on Global Alliances</h3>
<p>The overhaul strained alliances like NATO—where Trump pushed for higher defense spending (up to 5% of GDP via the Hague Commitment)—and redefined relations with adversaries like Russia and China. Domestically, executive orders froze much foreign aid, impacting global humanitarian efforts.</p>

<p>Internationally, it led to winners like Saudi Arabia (strengthened ties) and losers like China (heightened tensions). The overhaul, influenced by Project 2025, included embassy closures and a focus on domestic security over democracy promotion.</p>

<p>By year-end, this approach was seen as ending an era of U.S.-led global stability, with mixed results: some de-escalations but increased unpredictability.</p>`,

                slug: "china-rare-earth-export-ban-2025",
                excerpt: "In retaliation to U.S. tariffs, China enacted export controls on rare-earth elements starting April 2025, halting shipments of critical minerals essential for electronics, EVs, and defense tech.",
                content: `<p>In retaliation to U.S. tariffs and technology restrictions imposed early in 2025, China enacted export controls on rare-earth elements starting April 4, halting shipments of critical minerals like tungsten, molybdenum, and rare earths essential for electronics, EVs, and defense tech.</p>

<h3>Escalating Trade War</h3>
<p>This move, expanded in October to include production equipment and battery materials, imposed extraterritorial jurisdiction and a "50% rule" for compliance, affecting global supply chains. The ban forced Trump to negotiate a partial pause in November, suspending some curbs for a year while retaining licensing systems, as U.S. industries faced shortages.</p>

<h3>Global Impact</h3>
<p>Impacts included skyrocketing prices for semiconductors and renewables, prompting diversification efforts in the West, but highlighting China's dominance (over 80% of global supply). The truce eased immediate tensions but left underlying trade frictions unresolved, exacerbating U.S.-China rivalry.</p>`,

                slug: "israel-us-strikes-iran-nuclear-2025",
                excerpt: "Tensions boiled over in June 2025 when Israel and the U.S. launched coordinated airstrikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, killing over 1,000 and heightening regional instability.",
                content: `<p>Tensions boiled over in June 2025 when Israel launched airstrikes on June 13 against Iran's nuclear facilities, including Natanz and Fordow, followed by U.S. bombings on three sites on June 21, reportedly destroying key centrifuges and infrastructure.</p>

<h3>Military Escalation</h3>
<p>This escalation, amid Iran's missile sites and energy targets, killed over 1,000 and aimed to halt Iran's nuclear program, which U.S. intelligence assessed as not fully destroyed despite claims. A fragile ceasefire followed in July, brokered amid U.S. pressure, but unresolved disputes lingered.</p>

<h3>Regional Consequences</h3>
<p>Iran remained undeterred and Netanyahu pushed for further action against Trump's de-escalation priorities. The strikes heightened regional instability, drew in proxies like Hezbollah, and marked a flashpoint in Israel-Iran hostilities, contributing to global oil price spikes and fears of broader war.</p>`,

                excerpt: "Entering its fourth year, Russia achieved minimal territorial gains in 2025 despite high casualties, while U.S. support waned under Trump and ceasefire talks stalled.",
                content: `<p>Entering its fourth year, Russia achieved minimal gains in 2025—about 4,700 square kilometers—despite high casualties (over 1,000 daily) and use of North Korean troops (deployed then withdrawn in February). Ukraine countered with drone strikes on Russian bases, including Moscow.</p>

<h3>Shifting International Support</h3>
<p>While Europe ramped up aid (e.g., long-range missiles), U.S. support waned under Trump, shifting focus to domestic issues. Ceasefire talks stalled, with Russia demanding full control of Donbas and Ukraine resisting; Zelensky planned meetings with Trump by year-end.</p>

<h3>Key Developments</h3>
<p>Key moments included Russian offensives in Kharkiv and Donetsk, Ukrainian incursions into Kursk, and a December 22-23 missile barrage. The war displaced millions, caused famine risks, and eroded global peace, with analysts doubting quick resolution amid Russia's optimism for 2026 victory.</p>`,

                excerpt: "After two years of fighting, a U.S.-mediated three-phase ceasefire took effect in October 2025, involving hostage exchanges, troop withdrawals, and humanitarian aid surges.",
                content: `<p>After two years of fighting, a U.S.-mediated three-phase ceasefire took effect in October 2025, involving hostage exchanges (dozens released), troop withdrawals, and humanitarian aid surges. Brokered by figures like Jared Kushner and involving Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, it built on prior failed truces in November 2023 and March 2025.</p>

<h3>Fragile Implementation</h3>
<p>Implementation was shaky, with violations like Israeli strikes on a Gaza wedding in December and Hamas "changes" to terms, but it survived tests and was deemed "better than expected" by VP Vance. Announced by Biden in his farewell, it offered hope amid devastation (over 40,000 dead).</p>

<h3>Uncertain Future</h3>
<p>The ceasefire enabled reconstruction but left governance and security unresolved. International observers remain cautious about the long-term stability of the agreement, with both sides maintaining conflicting positions on key issues.</p>`,
