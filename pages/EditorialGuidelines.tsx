            <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Editorial Guidelines</h1>

            <p className="mb-6 text-gray-600">
                At Gossip Gazette, we are committed to the highest standards of journalism. These editorial guidelines
                outline our principles, processes, and practices that ensure we deliver accurate, fair, and trustworthy
                news to our readers.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Editorial Philosophy</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Our editorial philosophy is built on three core principles: accuracy, independence, and transparency.
                We believe that quality journalism serves the public interest by providing reliable information that
                helps people make informed decisions about their lives and communities.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                We are committed to reporting the truth, even when it's uncomfortable or unpopular. We do not allow
                commercial interests, political pressures, or personal biases to influence our editorial decisions.
                Our loyalty is to our readers and to the facts.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Accuracy and Fact-Checking</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Accuracy is the foundation of credible journalism. Before publishing any article, we follow a rigorous
                fact-checking process:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Multiple Source Verification:</strong> We require at least two independent sources to confirm
                    significant facts, especially for breaking news or controversial claims.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Source Review:</strong> Whenever possible, we consult original documents, data, and
                    primary sources rather than relying solely on secondary reporting.</li>
                <li><strong>Expert Consultation:</strong> For technical or specialized topics, we consult subject matter
                    experts to ensure accuracy and context.</li>
                <li><strong>Quote Verification:</strong> All quotes are verified with the source or from reliable recordings
                    or transcripts. We never fabricate or alter quotes.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Statistics and data are cross-checked against authoritative sources
                    and properly attributed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Source Verification and Attribution</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                We maintain strict standards for source verification and attribution:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Named Sources:</strong> We prefer on-the-record, named sources whenever possible. This allows
                    readers to evaluate the credibility of information for themselves.</li>
                <li><strong>Anonymous Sources:</strong> We use anonymous sources only when the information is newsworthy,
                    cannot be obtained any other way, and the source faces genuine risk. Anonymous sources must be approved
                    by senior editors.</li>
                <li><strong>Source Diversity:</strong> We seek diverse perspectives and voices in our reporting, including
                    those who may disagree with our conclusions.</li>
                <li><strong>Conflicts of Interest:</strong> We disclose any potential conflicts of interest that sources
                    may have, allowing readers to assess credibility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Corrections and Updates Policy</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                When we make mistakes, we correct them promptly and transparently:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Immediate Corrections:</strong> Factual errors are corrected as soon as they are identified,
                    regardless of how minor they may seem.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear Labeling:</strong> All corrections are clearly labeled and dated, explaining what was
                    wrong and what has been corrected.</li>
                <li><strong>Significant Errors:</strong> For significant errors that materially affect the story's meaning,
                    we publish a separate correction notice and update the article with a prominent note.</li>
                <li><strong>Reader Feedback:</strong> We welcome and investigate reader reports of potential errors through
                    our <Link to="/contact" className="text-blue-500 hover:underline">contact page</Link>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Editorial Independence</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Our editorial decisions are made independently of commercial, political, or personal interests:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Advertising Separation:</strong> Our editorial content is completely separate from our
                    advertising operations. Advertisers have no influence over our coverage.</li>
                <li><strong>Sponsored Content:</strong> Any sponsored or paid content is clearly labeled as such and
                    meets the same editorial standards as our regular content.</li>
                <li><strong>Political Independence:</strong> We do not endorse political candidates or parties. Our
                    coverage aims to inform readers, not to advocate for particular political outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Disclosure:</strong> We disclose any financial relationships that could create
                    conflicts of interest in our reporting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Fairness and Balance</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                We strive for fairness and balance in all our reporting:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Multiple Perspectives:</strong> We seek out and present multiple perspectives on controversial
                    issues, giving readers the information they need to form their own opinions.</li>
                <li><strong>Right of Reply:</strong> When reporting on allegations or criticism of individuals or
                    organizations, we make reasonable efforts to contact them for comment before publication.</li>
                <li><strong>Context and Nuance:</strong> We provide sufficient context to help readers understand complex
                    issues, avoiding oversimplification or false equivalence.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoiding Bias:</strong> While complete objectivity is impossible, we work to identify and
                    minimize our biases and present information fairly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Distinguishing News from Opinion</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                We clearly distinguish between news reporting, analysis, and opinion:
            </p>

                    clearly labeled as analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Opinion Content:</strong> Opinion pieces express the views of individual authors and are
                    clearly labeled as opinion or commentary.</li>
                <li><strong>Editorial Voice:</strong> We maintain a consistent, professional editorial voice across all
                    content types.</li>
            </ul>
